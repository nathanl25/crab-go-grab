## Requirements / Purpose

- Crab Go Grab is a multiplayer game loosely based on the game "Hoo Hey How" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoo_Hey_How . Players can select one of 6 options, and a dice is rolled. When the dice is rolled, a player who has selected an option which has the same outcome as the dice wins, and players who have selected the right option lose.
